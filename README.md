# Real-Time Gesture Control and Pose Detection

This project aims to perform hand gesture recognition using the Mediapipe library and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. It demonstrates the basics of body pose detection, facial landmark estimation, and hand pose detection using a single Mediapipe library and your webcam.

The project uses Mediapipe Holistic, a deep learning model, to accurately detect keypoints in real-time video. This technology opens up various potential applications, including touchless gesture control, human sentiment analysis, and even building your own exercise counter.
